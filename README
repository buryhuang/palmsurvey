Projects: Open Source Database Program for PalmOS
-------------------------------------------------

*** WARNING: While every effort has been made to find and remove bugs
*** from Projects, it is still under active development. You use it at
*** your own risk! Since Projects is still under active development,
*** there may be bugs which will cause your PDA to crash to the point
*** where a hard reset is required. (Hard resets cause loss of all data
*** on the PDA.)

Projects is a flat-file database application for PalmOS-compatile PDAs
from companies such as Palm, Handspring, HandEra and Sony. Using
Projects, you can create more than just one ToDo list like in the
built-in ToDo application provided with the operating system.

Projects is Free Software provided under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL). Read the file "COPYING" that is included in this
distribution to learn more about the GNU GPL.

Since Projects is under constant development, read the file "NEWS" also
included in this distribution to learn what major changes have taken
place since previous releases.

Installation
------------

Projects is available in different version (configurations). You can can
download the source code and build a special version satisfying your
needs. With the binary package there are shiped the following versions.
The versions require a Palm OS version of 3.1 or above if not otherwise
specified. At the current time the character secquence '[??]' in the
listed files below is replaced by ...

 ... 'En' -> English translation (by Peter Novotnik)
 ... 'Ge' -> German translation (by Peter Novotnik)
 ... 'It' -> Italian translation (by Manuel Giorgini)
 ... 'Fr' -> French translation (by Eric Santonacci)

 Projects[??]BW.prc
 - basic functionality, no color support (black/white)

 Projects[??]Color.prc
 - basic functionality, support for colors

 Projects[??]BWSony.prc
 - basic functionality, no color support (black/white),
 - support of sony's high screen resolution, min. required os version 3.5

 Projects[??]ColorSony.prc
 - basic functionality, support for color,
 - support of sony's high screen resolution and JogDial, min. required os version 3.5

 Projects[??]HandEra.prc
 - basic functionality, no support for colors,
 - support of HandEra330's high resolution screen and JogDial, min. required os version 3.5

The next step is to actually install one of those files above on the PDA.
Users of Microsoft Windows and the Macintosh should use the Install Tool
that comes with the Palm Desktop software to install one of the above
listed PRC files. Afterwards, initiate a HotSync to complete
the installation.

UNIX/Linux users should use a program like 'pilot-xfer' which is a
part of the pilot-link package to install one of the above PRC files.
(Other packages like KPilot, JPilot and gnome-pilot will work just as
well.)

NOTE that if you install different language versions of Projects it may
cause a small problem. If you see the Projects' symbol twice in the
application laucher you have two different language versions installed.
To fix this problem get a tool like 'Filez' and delete the application
executable database. The english, italian and french application database 
reads 'Projects' and the german 'Projekte'. Do NOT use the 'Delete...' 
menu item of the application launcher or you will earse all your Projects
data!

Projects supports also JogDial and high resolution screens available on 
Sony and HandEra330 devices. However you need to disable JogAssistant on 
Sony devices to make Projects work properly with this feature.
